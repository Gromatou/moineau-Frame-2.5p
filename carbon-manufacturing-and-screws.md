## 🛠️ Carbon Fiber Frame Manufacturing Instructions

### **Carbon Plates** 🛡️

| Component | Details | Requirement for Strength |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top Plate** | T700 Carbon Fiber | **2 mm** thick |
| **Bottom Plate** | T700 Carbon Fiber | **3 mm** thick |

* **Carbon Fiber Orientation**
    > It is **crucial to respect the carbon fiber orientation** as shown in the manufacturing diagram to ensure the frame's maximum strength and resistance to flex. 

### **🪛 Screw Choices (Screws and Standoffs)**

* **Required Screw List**
    * **14x M2x6** : For propellers and main frame standoffs.
    * **16x M2x5** : For motor mounting.
    * **4x M2x5** (Flat Head) : For securing the Bottom Plate.

* **Stack Screw Selection (For AIO + VTX / HD Builds)**
    * **Flight Stack (AIO FC + VTX/Receiver)** : **4x M2x16** screws + **4x 14 mm** standoffs.

* **Weight Saving Recommendation (Crucial for Performance)** 🚀
    > For **significant weight reduction**, the use of **titanium screws** and **aluminum alloy standoffs** is highly recommended. This substitution can save approximately **6%** of the total Take-Off Weight (**TOW**).
